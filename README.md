# Whatsapp Direct Messaging API
This API allows user to create a link to their whatsapp account without the needs to save the phone number. Using it on the desktop will start a conversation using Whatsapp Web while on mobile Whatsapp will automatically open and start a conversation.

It's more like 'Click to Whatsapp' thingy or maybe 'Surf to Whatsapp'. Have fun!

> You can also use the official one below.

## Features
1. You can use your own domain.
2. No more saving phone number just to start a conversation.
3. Directly open whatsapp application using web for desktop and app for mobile (the official api doesn't do this, will ask the user to click send button).
